    We take our cheese serious here in Wisconsin and as a supplier of cheese since 1955, Jim's Cheese is constantly in need of marketing material that is distributed to thousands of clients and customers across the nation. Since 2010, we have delivered two websites, marketing collateral, photography, social media and outbound marketing campaigns. Most recently we updated the logo, packaging labels, designed and developed a new customer centered responsive website.

    Most brands come with decades of history, which can often make it hard to recognize when it's time for an update and that's ok. When we initally presented the idea of a logo re-design, we got the sense that our friends over at Jim's did not want to part with particular elements they had become familiar with, so with that in mind we kept it light and made slight updates to the fonts. With a new font and the old icon we rearraned the logo keeping it recognizable and versatile as it's used on their packaging, marketing collateral, web and social media outlets.
