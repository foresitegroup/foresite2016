  The University School of Milwaukee was looking to develop a micro-site to introduce and promote their "Our Common Bond Campagin," a program that seeks funding to enhance critical areas of school life. The strategy in the design introduces the user to the campaign, leads them to the goals and then displays the opportunities so the information is delivered in a digestable order. The site is also loaded with imagery, video and built for any display on any platform with room to phase in online donations.

    USM made it clear they wanted the numbers up front and center, so we animated the graphics, strategically placed CTAs, and integrated images and video to keep the audience engaged.<br>

  "Our school had a great experience working with Foresite. They delivered a microsite with stunning design, animated features that really make it "pop", and were responsive to our needs and numerous content changes on our end. I'd definitely recommend working with them."<br>
