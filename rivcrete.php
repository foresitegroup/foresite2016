  Riv/Crete is a family owned company in the Milwaukee area that delivers concrete at the highest levels of quality and standards. They combine the innovation and enthusiasm of a new company with the knowledge, experience and capability of a senior company. We strove to showcase the energy and innovation within Riv/Crete's culture by creating an alluring site using modern design sensibilities & use of video; while creating engagement with such elements as our "volume calculator" used as an aid while ordering concrete.<br>

    While the main focus of the site was to display Riv/Crete's products and available services - special care was also given to showcasing some of their award-winning projects (above-left), as well as allowing easy access to employment opportunities (above-right). Contact was also streamlined, allowing quick determination of what customers need by the inclusion of a volume calculator, and easy contact via form (right).
