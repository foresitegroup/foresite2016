  As the Nicolet FEAR team has grown to over 50 students and 15 mentors, so did there need for a functional web site, which now features a student driven social media &amp; news feed, sponsorship information &amp; a calendar useful for parents and students. Utilizing the student provided brand guidelines we also were able to create a relatively straightforward site with user friendly navigation, information &amp; media sections all of which students have the ability to update through a CMS on the backend.
