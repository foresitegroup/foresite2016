  The Wisconsin Policy Forum is a statewide nonpartisan, independent policy research organization with offices in Milwaukee and Madison. Their mission is to provide informed analysis of critical policy issues affecting local governments, school districts, and the state of Wisconsin. We were honored to work with an organization with such a vital and important mission, and strove to find the best ways to display their research and encourage engagement with their mission.<br>

  Wisconsin Policy Forum's research is at the heart of their mission to educate and inform. We wanted to bring this research to the forefront by creating an easy to navigate online research library with numerous filtering, tagging and search features. Individual research pages were given a variety of methods to bring depth and engagement to WPF's research &mdash; including the ability to feature video content, media coverage, and even interactive data.
