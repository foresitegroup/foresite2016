    Tee To Green is an annual golf tournament hosted in conjunction with The First Tee of Southeast Wisconsin. It's existence is to impact the lives of young people throughout Southeastern Wisconsin by providing learning facilities and educational programs that promote character development and life-enhancing values through the game of golf. They approached us in need of some branding, with little direction, we presented them with a series of different logos for the event, choosing the one pictured. The logo was designed to be simple, yet flexible enough to use on various mediums from web to various print projects such as a sell sheet promoting the core values of the event.
